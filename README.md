# PersonalCostForecast

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting the target variable "charges" by employing Linear Regression with a dataset containing 7 variables. The objective was to identify the most influential feature in predicting charges. To achieve this, the following steps were taken:

1-Model Creation from Scratch:
The Linear Regression model was built entirely from scratch, providing a hands-on understanding of the underlying principles.

2-Feature Selection:
Six different models were created, each utilizing a different feature alongside the target variable. The cost function was calculated for each model, and the feature resulting in the lowest cost function was selected as the primary predictor.

## Key Features:
- Implementation of Linear Regression from scratch
- Feature selection based on cost function comparison
- Utilization of a dataset with 7 variables, targeting the "charges" variable

## Mathematical Formulas:
1. **Linear Regression Model:**
   - The equation of the linear regression model is given by:
     $$ y = mx + b $$

2. **Cost Function**
   - The function is defined as:
     $$ J(w, b) = (1 / n) * Σ(yᵢ - w * xᵢ - b)   for i from 1 to 1338 $$
